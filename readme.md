## Explanation

Currently, we have five fundamental features in our project:

1. **Job Application Tracking:** Keep an organized record of job applications, including a wish list, application history, and the ability to add prospective offers.

2. **Project Management Integration:** Extend the application's functionality beyond job applications to create dynamic boards and columns for project management.

3. **Customization:** Customize columns, titles, descriptions, and workflow stages to match your unique needs.

4. **Efficient Updates:** Easily track progress with detailed updates, stage assignments, and a drag-and-drop feature for seamless task management.

5. **Data Security:** Ensure your information is stored securely with data persistence in a database, accessible for the long term.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Node.Js
- Flask
- MongoDB
- React

## Installation

### Requirements:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (recommended >= 3.8)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) (Latest version 21.3 used as of 11/3)
- [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Latest version 6.14.4 used as of 11/3)

### Strongly Recommended:

- A terminal environment capable of handling bash scripts.

To install all required packages, while within the context of the project root directory, run:

```
./setup.sh
```
This will handle all npm and pip package installations required for both the front and backend.

*If the script says "command not found" or something similar, run chmod +x ./setup.sh. This grants the script execution privileges. Depending on your setup, this may occur for the boot_dockerless files, amongst others. The same command will fix the issue.*

## Getting Started:
### Boot:
To run a testing environment, run:
```
./startup.sh
```
This will run flask and npm simultaneously, booting both the front and backend. Note - npm takes substantially longer to boot compared to flask.
### Shutdown:
To ensure that flask is no longer occupying a port, run:
```
./shutdown.sh
```
This will search for any active process containing "flask" and kill the process.

## Hosting the Database:
### Local MongoDB:
1. Download [MongoDB Community Server](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)
2. Follow the [Installion Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/server/install/)
3. In  ```app.py```  set  ```'host'```  string to  ```'localhost'```
4. Run the local database: 
``` 
mongod 
```
* Recommended: Use a GUI such as [Studio 3T](https://studio3t.com/download/) to more easily interact with the database


### Hosted database with MongoDB Atlas:
1. [Create account](https://account.mongodb.com/account/register) for MongoDB
 
** ___If current MongoDB Atlas owner adds your username/password to the cluster, skip to step 4___ **

2. Follow MongoDB Atlas [Setup Guide](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/) to create a database collection for hosting applications
3. In  ```app.py```  set  ```'host'```  string to your MongoDB Atlas connection string
4. Create an  ```application.yml```  file in the /backend directory with the specifications:
```
username: <MongoDB Atlas cluster username>
password: <MongoDB Atlas cluster password>
```
5. For testing through CI to function as expected, repository secrets will need to be added through the settings. Create individual secrets with the following keys/values:
```
MONGO_USER: <MongoDB Atlas cluster username>
MONGO_PASS: <MongoDB Atlas cluster password>
```
