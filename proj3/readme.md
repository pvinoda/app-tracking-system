| Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often X times more productive than the others...) | 3 | Responsibility was spread evenly between the group members in terms of functionality but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot |
| Number of commits | 3 | Overall, there were a significant number of quality commits -  |
| Number of commits: by different people | 3 |  |
